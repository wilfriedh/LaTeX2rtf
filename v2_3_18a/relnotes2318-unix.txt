This is the unix package: Contains ONLY source code. 
 It has to be compiled and installed before it can be used. 
 The source code is not restricted to unix systems but 
 can also be compiled on several other systems, including Mac OS X.

Changes (since 2.3.8)

Switch to use the recent version of Ghostscript.
Use eps2eps from Ghostscript instead of from MikTeX distribution. 
 Therefore changed the order of program folders in PATH setting
 in l2rshell.exe (windows GUI) as well as in l2rprep.bat
Modified latex2png script for compatibility with Ghostscript 9.14 and newer
(gs 9.14 and newer use a different eps2eps script producing better quality eps 
 files on the expense of containing binary stuff)

Changes (since 2.3.7)

 * extra blank after exclamation mark and after question mark removed

Changes (since 2.3.6)

 * when converting equations to bitmaps or eps, some equations 
   incorrectly got double numbers. 
   Fixed by replacing \begin{equation}...\end{equation}
   by \begin{displaymath}...\end{displaymath}

Changes (since 2.3.5)

 * updated address of Free Software Foundation (General Public License)

Changes (since 2.3.4)

 * when converting equations to bitmaps or eps, some equations were 
   not correctly converted because \begin{equation}...\end{equation}
   was replaced by $$...$$

Changes (since 2.3.3)

 * added basic support for tikz

Changes (since 2.3.2)

 * fixed bug in "WriteEquationAsBitmapOrEPS" 
    (do not split equations at \\ in align environments)

Changes (since 2.3.1)

 * creating html files in doc/web removed from doc/Makefile in Unix distribution
   (but not in SVN repository)

 * fixed bug in "PutEpsFile" and "PutPdfFile" 
    (converted eps file name did not include temp folder)

New features (since 2.3.1)

 * better support for documents which need pdflatex or xelatex
   when converting equations to bitmaps or eps files

Changes (since 2.3.0) include

 * fixed bug in "PutEpsFile" (variable eps was undefined)
 * fixed bug in funct1.c (figure numbers missing with "-F" option,
   patch tracker no.3537371)

Changes (since 2.2.1) include

 * Equations inserted as eps file names have enlarged bounding boxes and
   their insertion points in the text are shifted down 5 points, which
   ensures a correct baseline in most cases.

New features (since 2.2.0) include

 * allow conversion of equations and/or pdf and ps figures to eps files 
   with insertion of eps or bitmap file names in the text, delimited by [###...###]

Changes (since 2.1.0) include

 * When inserting the raw LaTeX code of equations (-M32 option), 
   equations are now delimited by $...$ or \[...\]
   which allows MathType to recognize and convert them.

New features (since 2.1.0) include

 * allow specifying the folder for temporary files (-T option)
   also under Windows. If this folder is specified in the GUI shell, 
   it will be created if it does not yet exist.

New features (since 2.0.0) include

 * better support for the acronym package
 * support for the preamble command \graphicspath{}
 * apply MS Word styles more consistently
